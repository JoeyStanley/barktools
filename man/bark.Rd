\title{Convert between Hz and Barks.}
\usage{
bark(x)

hz(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A number.}
}
\value{
The number transformed into Barks or Hz.
}
\description{
Use \code{bark()} to convert Hz into Barks. Use \code{hz()} to convert Barks
back into Hz. Both of these functions are based on the formula provided
Traunmüller (1990).
}
\section{Note}{
 Because the Traunmüller's formula is not especially precise
  (especially because Zwicker's original scale was biased toward nice round
  numbers), there will inevitably be some rounding error. However, it is 
  small enough that it should be of little consequence.
